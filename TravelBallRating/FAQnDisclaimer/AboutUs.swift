                            TravelBallRating is a passion project I’ve developed over the past year with Brazilian Jiu Jitsu practitioners in mind. As a BJJ brown belt with over 10 years of training in Orange County, CA, I know the struggle of finding the right team or open mat while traveling. By profession, I’m a Software Product Delivery Manager and Business Analyst, usually focused on the client side of system applications. This, however, is my first venture into building an app from scratch.

                            The idea came from necessity and curiosity. Traveling frequently, I often wondered if there was a nearby team with an open mat, and whether I should pack my Gi or NoGi gear. Too often, my searches led to vague results—“grappling” classes at a generic "martial arts" dojo or teams that were far from convenient. Frustrated, I decided to create TravelBallRating: a way for BJJ practitioners to list, locate, and review open mats, class schedules, and plan their training, wherever they are.

You enjoy attending different open mats, or you love your team and want to see your open mats expand beyond the same 5-10 regulars. You are being asked to pilot this app: add teams, add open mat times, and overall, help test TravelBallRating for user experience (UX). Your feedback on bugs and any related issues is crucial.

                            The answer is no. Currently, and I hope to change this, there is no existing API database I can link up to gather this data. If there were, the app would have been either easier to build or probably unnecessary. BJJ teams often change their open mat schedules on a whim. What might be a Saturday at 9am could change for the summer to Sunday at 10am, or a new open mat might be added. If it were easy to scrub the data, we wouldn’t need this app. Thus, I rely on the BJJ community to enter their team's open mats, or any open mats they know of in the area. Using your current location or the area you are visiting, you can enter an address or postal code to find an open mat near you.

                            For now, the app is completely free and ad-free. Currently, it’s a service I want to offer to the BJJ community. Eventually, the app will have ads and other monetization features (it would be nice to be compensated for my effort, and hosting an app or related data on the app stores isn’t free for me).
